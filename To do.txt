Fix flipswitch not always reflecting enabled status (Should work idk why not? Maybe track state as bool in switch, use darwin notification callback when enabled changes to change it)
Fix screen going completely black in some cases

Changes since last version:
Now disables itself temporarily when a screenshot is taken so it doesn't darken the screenshot
